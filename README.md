# Medinfo 2019
## Hands-On Full Life Cycle Data Science Tutorial


##### Note: These instructions are also available (with screenshots) in the "Medinfo2019 -  Instructions to Install Jupyter Notebook.pdf"
Thank you for your interest in the workshop.  This is a “hands-on” workshop which means that you will need to bring a laptop so that you can follow along, execute code and do short exercises as we work through aspects of a data science project.  For this workshop we will be running all of the notebooks in the cloud.

The advantage to running the environment in the cloud is that there is nothing to install!  We will be using the Google Colab environment.  One disadvantage is that the environment will shut down after 12 hours of use.  That is fine for the purpose of this workshop, but probably is not what you’d want to use for a production data science environment.

To access the system, go to the following URL in a browser (Chrome works best):
https://colab.research.google.com/  This will launch a new virtual environment where you can play with the workshop notebooks.  Make sure you have a Google login and are logged into the Colab service.  Check to make sure the environment is working by doing the following:

1.	When you go https://colab.research.google.com, a pop-up screen will ask you which notebook to open.  Click the “GITHUB” tab and then put in "joh06288" for the Github URL and find the "medinfo2019" repository and select the “Check_Environment” notebook:

2.	Navigate to the main menu and select “Runtime -> Run all”.  You will be warned that the notebook is not from Google and that your runtimes will be reset.  Pick “Run anyway” and “Yes” to run the notebook. If 

3.	The final message should say “Congratulations, your environment is setup correctly!”

4.	If you have problems, there will be time at the Workshop to help you troubleshoot.  Please come to the workshop meeting room 30 minutes early on the day of the workshop and we can help resolve the problem.

5.	If you are interested, you can take a look at the “Intro_to_Jupyter” notebook which is a quick overview of some of the libraries that we will be using during the workshop.
